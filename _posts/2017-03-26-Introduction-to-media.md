Media Navigator Lesson 1 Homework

Name:Luke Harrison___      Date: 20/03/17_

Assignment: Select a media example. This could be a commercial, billboard, radio ad, or magazine ad. 

Answer the questions below:

Name of media example you deconstructed: [Eyes on the road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Nh7IAIOVA)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Who is the target audience in this media example? (Be specific)</td>
    <td>What is the subtext (hidden or underlying message) in this media example?</td>
    <td>What are the untold stories
(what information is left out of
the message)?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This media example is aimed at young people who just learnt how to drive. This is because, young people are very obsessed with their mobile phones. If one of them got a text from someone, they would look at it and not be focusing on what they are doing(which in most cases are driving.) Due to this, it is clear who this advert is aimed at - young people who just learnt how to drive.</td>
    <td>The hidden message is that nothing is as important as keeping your eyes on the road. This is implied by the advert showing that everyone looks at their phone and then the car crashes. This means that if you get a text or someone is trying to call you, you ignore it until you are not driving. This is a reason for my statement (at the top) because, if you want to keep yourself safe, then keep your eyes on the road.</td>
    <td>In my opinion, the information that is left out is that everything can happen in  a split second and only you can stop it. The reasons for this are, that they never showed us or told us that a life can change within a split second. I think this is left out for effect as it gets the viewer thinking and asking questions like: what if they didn't look at their phone? Etc. It gets the viewer alert to never look at their phone whilst driving .</td>
