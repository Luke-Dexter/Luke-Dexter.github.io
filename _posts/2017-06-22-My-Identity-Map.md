My Identity Map 

What went well in my Identity Map:

In my identity map the thing that went really well were all of the comments that my class gave me because they were mostly good comments and they also made me feel extremely proud of myself for getting those certain comments. The good comments that I got because of my identity map were how people really liked my colour scheme and how many pictures I put on my piece of work. Another thing that they did put was that they really liked my springing features and how I incorporated a world showing the things important and not so important to me. Some people also really liked how I did a lot of writing as well as making sure that it was not just a piece of paper with an essay on it. My timeline was another thing that some people liked. Billy was one of those people who liked my timeline. Raphael was one  of the people that really liked my layout and design. Ben liked the amount of colour, writing and pictures that I put into my identity map.

Some of the comments that I am a bit confused as to why they wrote it:

There were a few comments that I was a bit bewildered as to why they wrote that particular comment. Charlie Bach's comment was one that I got confused over because he wrote, "where is your name?" yet if you look on the front cover, it is quite visible that I wrote Luke Harrison on the front of it. Another comment that  confused me was Keenan’s comment as he put, “add social media logos as an EBI. Looking at my work it is clearly visible that I have added in the certain logos for the social media sites that I use.

My overall fell of my Identity Map

 I am extremely pleased with how my Identity map went because I managed to get a very high mark on that homework which is quite surprising as I do not usually get a very high score in any of my I.T projects. Another that made me smile was how nice the people in my class were about my Identity Map and they also wrote such nice comments. 

    In conclusion, I am extremely happy with my I.T homework. I am over the moon with joy because of this.
