    <td>Time limited my learning as I found that it took me a lot of time to complete this assessment. I need to work on using my time more effectively so perhaps doing 30 mins of this work 2-3 times a week as opposed to 2 hours in one night. 
I also learnt that I need to go back and check my work as when I did this I noticed I had missed out a few steps which caused me confusion.

    <td>If I were to do this again I would change my attitude to listening in class as I found that I was not sure how to do some things as I could not remember all that was said as I was not paying attention. I would now write some things down so that it would help me recall class discussions.
I will improve my learning by paying full attention to what is being said in class and I will also write down notes which will help me remember key stages and allow me to keep up with the other boys.
