    <td>The strategies that I used to start off were that I asked Mr Keen questions when I wasn't sure. I also asked my friends when I was stuck. This helped me because I didn't get confused as much. Another strategy I used alot was to take notes when Mr Keen was talking to the class. This allowed me to keep up with the class and I knew what I was I was doing most of the time. I learnt by giving my full attention to the responses I got from Mr Keen and my friends.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on my concentration as in the lesson I was doing the wrong thing for half of the lesson. I was more focused on how my blog looked than the content so I ended up having 5 mintues to do as much as I could of my content. I need to work on my noting kills as when Mr Keen was talking I noted down some of the wrong facts which made it a tiny bit confusing. This was a HUGE mistake...

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>If I were to do this again I would change the order of the things that I need to do. I need to get the content done first and then worry about how my blog looks. Another thing I would change is who I ask when i'm stuck as I asked some people and then they said teh wrong thing which was really confusing. I will improve on my learning by noting down the right facts when my teacher is speaking. This will result in me not getting confused.
