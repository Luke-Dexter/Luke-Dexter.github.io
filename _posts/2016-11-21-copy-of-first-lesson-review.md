    <td>The strategies that I used to start off with when I was publishing my blog was that I followed the slides that Mr Keen (my teacher) had posted on Google Classroom. I worked out that in the end it was fairly simple to publish my blog as long as I followed the instructions carefully. When I was changing my background I noticed that I had to go into the style.scss file since the background is a part of the style of my blog which confused me initially. After I had found the place where I could change my background I went to the slides on Google Classroom so I knew what to input into the background section. I found an image I liked and entered it into the style.scss file and then my background changed which was the successful outcome I was looking for.
I learnt that by following the instructions on the slides carefully I could achieve my goal. 
By doing this assessment I learnt about codes and that you can actually publish your own website which I did not know before.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Time limited my learning as I found that it took me a lot of time to complete this assessment. I need to work on using my time more effectively so perhaps doing 30 mins of this work 2-3 times a week as opposed to 2 hours in one night. 
I also learnt that I need to go back and check my work as when I did this I noticed I had missed out a few steps which caused me confusion.

    <td>If I were to do this again I would change my attitude to listening in class as I found that I was not sure how to do some things as I could not remember all that was said as I was not paying attention. I would now write some things down so that it would help me recall class discussions.
I will improve my learning by paying full attention to what is being said in class and I will also write down notes which will help me remember key stages and allow me to keep up with the other boys.
