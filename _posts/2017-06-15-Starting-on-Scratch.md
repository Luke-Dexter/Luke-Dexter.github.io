    <td>During that lesson, I mostly asked my friends for help when I was stuck on a level. I asked them for help and they helped me and so in return, I helped them whenever they were stuck on a level. The people I asked really helped me and they made sure I did not fall behind.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that how I was quite slow at most of the levels limited my learning as it meant that I did not get to level three as quick so I did not get all the code. Being slow also limited my learning as it meant that I also had more homework to do so that meant that I got less time in lessons to learn.</td>

    <td>Next time we have a lesson (next monday) I will make sure that I do not ask my friends so much and try to get as much of my own work done as possible. I will also try to get as much work as possible done in the lesson time given so that it will mean that I do not get as much homework.</td>
