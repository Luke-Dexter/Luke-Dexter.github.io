  <tr>
    <td>During this particular lesson, the most effective strategy that I used was that I did not do loads of work in a short amount of time. The reason why this was an effective strategy is because it helped me get better and take my time with coding. It also meant that I did not use up all of my energy at the start of the lesson and then didn't have any energy for the end. This is how I learnt during this lesson.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The main thing that limited my learning during this lesson was that I was speaking too much during the lessons. This limited my learning because it meant that sometimes I went a bit off subject which was not the proper thing that I was supposed to do. This was something that really limited my learning. I need to work on the habit of not going a bit of topic. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the next lesson that we have, I will make sure that when I am talking to someone about the work that I do not get sidetracked off topic and that I stay on task. This is the main thing that I will make sure I improve for next lesson for next time. This is the thing that will improve my experience in the lesson because it will result in myself getting more work done in the lesson and progressing further with Python and the coding. This will have a result of me being better at IT.</td>
