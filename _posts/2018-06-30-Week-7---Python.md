  <tr>
    <td>The ways in which I learnt during this particular lesson was the way in which I listened carefully to what my mind was saying and telling me to do. The reason why this helped was because this method made sure that we didn't get anything wrong and that we did not need to do the step again. This made our work more progressive and it made sure that there were no hindrances. It helped us progress further with the manual.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The one main thing that limited my learning was that the person sitting next to me was away at a music lesson and because I was ill last lesson, I just did not know where he got up to. This limited how much time I spent on doing the actual work. This happened because I did not know what to do. I eventually decided that I should just start from where I remember last in the manual. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next lesson, I will try and be a bit more independent and not just worry about the small things and just get on with the work. The way that I will achieve this is that I will just ponder and instead focus on the work. I will not rely on other people to help my with my own personal problems and instead, I will solve them out by myself and be a bit more independent as a person for the next lesson we have.</td>
