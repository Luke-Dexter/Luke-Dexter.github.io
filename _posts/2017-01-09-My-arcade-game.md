My arcade game

Games I Used:

* Donkey Kong is about a gorilla who throws barrels at mario.

* Pac Man is a game where you have to run away from ghosts and collect the coins which score you points.

* Space Invaders is a game where you are a ship and you are trying to shoot the baddies above you.

* Asteroids is a game where you have to  shoot all the ships around you.

* Frogger

* Tetris

* Thrust

* Track and Field 

* Zero Wing

Questions To Think About:drive

* What do the characters look like?

* Do you score points during the game?

* How do you score points?

* Do you have lives?

* When you die, do you restart from the beginning or from where you were?

* Does the game have levels?

* Does the difficulty change?

* Is the highest score remembered?(league table?)

* Is the game online?

* Are there goodies and baddies in the game?

* Single or Multiplayer?

* What is the objective of the game?

* Where is the game set?

Possible Ideas:

* I think my game will be my game will be like Zero Wing.

* 1 player.

* The objective of the game is to reach the mother ship and destroy it. 

* The game has lives and a score.

* There are 3 lives.

* There are baddies and one goddie.

* You score points by defeating the baddies.

* If you get shot, you lose a life.

* When you lose a life, you restart from the beginning.

* There are no levels but the game gets harder the more points you score.

* The character you are is a ship.

* It is set in a jungle.

* If you complete the game, your score will be put on the leaderboard dependent on how many points you get.

* It is not an online game.

What I need to make?

* A good ship.

* A bad mother ship.

* A lot of small, bad ships.
