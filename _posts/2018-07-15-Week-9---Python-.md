  <tr>
    <td>Throughout the course of that lesson, the strategy that I used that was the most effective was the way in which I just kept my head down and got on with the work instead of looking around and getting distracted. This helped me learn because it gave me a lot more personal time to get on with the work and it also helped me have a lot more focus on the work that was at hand and not the people around me.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things during that lessons that really limited my learning was that I was not paying 100% to the teacher (Mr Keen) and I was not completely paying attention to him when he was talking during that particular lesson. This was a bad thing because it meant that I was not all that sure on the work that I was doing as I was not listening o Mr Keen as much as I should have been.</td>

    <td>Next time we have a lesson (next monday) I will make sure that I am paying 100% to the things that are being said by the teacher when they are talking to the class. This is the thing that I will change for next lesson. I will improve my learning by paying attention and not not listening to Mr Keen as it will help me with the work that will be set. This is how I will improve my learning.</td>
