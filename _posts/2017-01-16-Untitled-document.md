Starting my own game.

Step 1: Planning

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What is your game about? Name it. Describe the gameplay/how it is played. What is the purpose of the game?
Add a description below to tell me about your game. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I am going to do a game that is based underwater. My game is about a scuba diver that is trying to find buried treasure but the water is infested with sharks. If the sharks manage to eat the scuba diver, you will lose a life. The scuba diver will have a total of 3 lives. When you lose a life,  you will go back to the last chest that you opened but if you get caught before 1st chest you go back to the start. You will play this by using the arrow keys to change the direction of the scuba diver and the key 'x' will make the scuba diver accelerate. There will be a score tally and you win points by finding the buried treasure. There will be a maximum of 50 points. Each chest gives you 10 points.  Once you get a chest, the game will get harder (more sharks.) There will be a total of 5 chests to collect. The purpose of my game is to get all 5 chests without losing all 3 lives. My game might be called ‘underwater chase,’ but I am not quite sure yet. If the player wins the game then there will be a change of background, it will change into a trophy with ‘you win’ written on the trophy.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>How will your game be won or lost? 
Make sure you add details here. Be precise.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My game will be won if the scuba diver manages to get all 5 chests without dying (losing all the lives.) The scuba diver gets eaten 3 times then the player will lose the game.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What elements need to be in your game? 
Describe/list what might need to be in your game: A fisherman that is trying to hook fish; the basket to land them in, etc. This part needs plenty of detail. Be thorough.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In my game, I will need the following elements:
A scuba diver that is trying to find the buried treasure.
5 treasure chests. 
A group of sharks that increase in numbers as the game gets harder.
An underwater background that moves as the diver moves.
A few extra underwater creatures for decoration.
A change of background if the player wins the game. </td>
  </tr>
