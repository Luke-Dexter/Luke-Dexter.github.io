    <td>The most useful strategy that I used during this lesson was to pay full attention to what was being said by Mr Keen when he was talking. This helped me in the in the fact that I knew what I was supposed to do and I knew where to put all the code. This was a big difference from my last lesson.
I also learnt by asking my friends for their advice whenever I was stuck and unsure. Another way I learnt was to concentrate fully on what I was doing so that I didn't make any mistakes.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I need to work on asking questions when I get stuck as I did find myself unsure a few times during the lesson but I didn’t feel confident enough to put my hand up and ask for help.  Next time this happens I hope to put my hand up and ask or talk with Mr Keen after the lesson. Another thing I need to work on is my ability to slow down and read carefully as I missed a few pieces of code as I was rushing which then made the lesson very confusing. 
I think that time (again) limited my learning as I didn’t think 1 hour was enough time to finish what we were supposed to do during the lesson and it all became a bit rushed for me..</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson that I have, I will change how I use my time as I need to make sure that I can finish what we’re doing in the time that is given.
I will improve my learning by changing the speed in which I read as I miss some code ( as I have already said.) This has happened to me before so next time I WILL make sure I slow down.
