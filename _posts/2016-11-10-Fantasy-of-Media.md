    <td>The strategies I used were to keep my head down and just focus on what I was doing - the assignment on breaking down a fantasy advert. This helped me because, I managed to get my work done in time which meant i didn't get into trouble and it meant that I could really  understand what we were doing.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on the habit of getting carried away (talking to my friends.) I did that when I was supposed to be listening to the teacher speaking and that led to me not fully understanding the task at hand. Doing this will help me because it will help me stay on track and make sure I am focused.

    <td>If I were to do this again I would change my amount of focus during the lesson. I do not focus that much because I am usually taking to my friends and not really paying attention to what we are doing in the lesson. Doing this will help me because it will keep me on track and make sure that I understand what we are doing in the lesson.
