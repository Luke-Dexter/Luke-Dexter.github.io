    <td>Throughout the course of that lesson, the strategy that I used that was the most effective was the way in which I asked the others around me when I was stuck on a certain stage of the programming. This strategy was effective because it meant that I was not spending an awful amount of time on a problem that I was stuck on. This got me further through Python which was a good result.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The main thing that limited my learning was that I was talking a bit too much during the lessons. This limited my learning because it meant that sometimes I went a bit off subject which was a really bad thing. This was a massive thing that limited my learning. I need to work on the habit of going a bit of topic. </td>

    <td>For the next lesson that we have, I will make sure that when I am talking to someone about the work that I do not get sidetracked off topic and that I stay on task. This is the main thing that I will change for next time. This is the thing that will improve my learning because it will result in myself getting more work done in the lesson and progressing further with Python. This is what I will change.</td>
