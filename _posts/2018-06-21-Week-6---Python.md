    <td>The main way in which I learnt during this lesson was that I was making sure that I was doing everything right. The way in which this helped me was that it made me 100% sure that I was doing everything right. It made me not have any doubts about the work that Rex and I were doing and it made me just do the work and not second guess water or not I was doing it completely right.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was that I was a bit confused at some parts throughout the lesson. The only reason why this happened was because the person sitting next to me was a bit further behind in codecademy than I was. This was a bad thing because it meant he was asking me for help but then I got confused as I was on a completely different stage of the booklet.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My thing that I will change for my next lesson of IT will be that I will make sure that I am up to speed with the work that I will be doing and that I will be ready for the next time that I come across someone who is further in front than me with the work. I will accomplish this by reading through the code and making sure that I am  to speed.
